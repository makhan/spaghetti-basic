Spaghetti is a very simple mini/toy-language interpreter. It is a very simplified language, resembling the syntax and grammar of early BASICs. There are no functions, scopes, or even loop syntax and most code involves judicious use of GOTOs and GOSUBs, hence its name :).

This is not meant to be a serious programming language, especially NOT a language for beginners to learn programming with.

For more details about what Spaghetti is and how to write code for it, see the [wiki](http://code.google.com/p/spaghetti-basic/w/list)

The project is currently in a very early and unstable state.
