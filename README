Spaghetti
v0.2

Spaghetti is a very simple mini/toy-language interpreter. It is a very simplified language, resembling the syntax and grammar of early BASICs. There are no functions, scopes, or even looping statement and most code involves judicious use of GOTOs and GOSUBs, hence its name :).

This is not meant to be a serious programming language, especially NOT a language for beginners to learn programming with. 

See documentation at project home (http://code.google.com/p/spaghetti-basic/) for details about the language

Spaghetti was developed on Linux (Ubuntu) using Python 2.6
It has not yet been tested on any other OS, but should work fine with Pyhton 2.6 installed. 
Python versions prior to 2.6 will not run Spaghetti.
